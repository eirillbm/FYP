Test 2: measurement noise (10%)

Test 3: process noise (1%, 5%)

Test 4: uncertainties in R (1% of each noise type, 10% measurement noise)

Test 5: uncertainties in Q (1% of each noise type, 5% process noise)

Test 6: uncertainties in Q & R (1% of each noise type)

Test 7: uncertainties in Plant initial conditions

Test 8: uncertainties in Kalman initial conditions

Test 9: uncertainties in Plant & Kalman initial conditions

Test 10: time delay (1 time step)

Test 11: time delay (2 time steps)

Time-varying Kalman filter: kalman_method=time-varying

Test 12: no disturbance

Test 13: signal loss (1, 2, 10 time steps)
